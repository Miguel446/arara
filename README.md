# Arara

Arara was created to facilitate the experience of people who want to consume fashion sustainably in Belém, Brazil. Here, you will find a catalog of various thrift shops, as well as information, photos and reviews of each of them. It's mission is to foster sustainable fashion while helping small businesses.

We believe that consuming fashion consciously is fundamental to preserving our planet and we want to contribute to this mission.
